    "summary": "Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the\npotential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are\nparamount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and\nhandcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce\n\\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework\nfor automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks\n(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits\nsequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward\nfunction that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,\nand gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse\nensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of\nsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz\ndesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image\nclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits\ndesigned by \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding\ncircuits that are 10$\\times$-30$\\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,\ngates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without\ncompromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles\nfrom real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of\ngenerative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum\ncircuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum\nalgorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.",

Such\nsimulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical\nto advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and\nmaterials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to\nclean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of\nall previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods,\nand it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale\nquantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we\nimplement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System\nModel H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit\nsystem that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the\nperiodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge\nseparation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the\nlimited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical\nsimulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum\ndevice. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the\neffective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between\ncharge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by\nclassical tensor network methods.

    "summary": "An $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gate is mainly utilized to construct other quantum\ngates and operators, such as Fredkin gates, arithmetical adders, and logical\ncomparators, where $n \\geq 2$. Several researchers introduced different methods\nto decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates in a quantum circuit into a set of\nstandard 3-bit Toffoli gates or a set of elementary quantum gates, such as\nsingle-qubit and two-qubit gates. However, these methods are not effectively\nreconfigurable for linearly connected symmetrical structures (layouts) of\ncontemporary quantum computers, usually utilizing more ancilla qubits. This\npaper introduces a new structural design method to effectively decompose\n$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates by utilizing configurable ancilla qubits, which we\nnamed the ``support qubits\". Collectively, we call our decomposition method for\nsymmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures\nshaped operators (Stesso)\". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable\nconstruct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate\nsub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and\nGeneralized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that\n$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using\nconventional composition methods.",

Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,\nlong readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.\nReducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors\nthat accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected\nphotons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves\nneutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but\nunreliable readout.\n  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,\nGANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear\nsignals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification\nat up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and\na pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up\nto 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art\nCNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.",

    "summary": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) protects qubits against bit- and phase-flip\nerrors in the |0> or |1> subspace, but physical qubits can also leak into\nhigher energy levels (e.g., |2>). Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts\nall subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits.\nDetecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are\nnever measured directly during QEC cycles. Prior work, such as eraser,\naddresses this by inferring leakage from syndrome patterns using a fixed\nheuristic. However, this approach often misclassifies benign syndromes,\ntriggering excessive leakage-reduction circuits (LRCs). Because LRCs are\nthemselves noisy and slow, these false triggers lengthen QEC cycles and inflate\nlogical error rates.\n  We propose gladiator, a general and adaptable leakage speculation framework\nthat works across surface code, color code, and qLDPC codes. Offline, gladiator\nbuilds a code-aware error-propagation graph calibrated to device data. Online,\nit classifies each syndrome in a few nanoseconds and schedules LRC only when\nthe observed pattern is provably leakage-dominated. This precise speculation\neliminates up to 3x (and on average 2x) unnecessary LRCs, shortens QEC cycles,\nand suppresses false positives at their source. Evaluated on standard\nfault-tolerant benchmarks, gladiator delivers 1.7x-3.9x speedups and 16%\nreduction in logical error rate, advancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant\nquantum computing.",

These are used as\ninputs to a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that discriminates known\ndriver genes from others. Simulations on an empirical PPI network demonstrate\ncompetitive performance, with a 12.6% recall gain over a classical baseline.\nThe pipeline performs explicit quantum state preparation and requires no\nclassical training, enabling an efficient, nearly end-to-end quantum workflow.\nA brief complexity analysis suggests the approach could achieve a quantum\nspeedup in network-based cancer gene prediction. This work underscores the\npotential of supervised quantum graph learning frameworks to advance biological\ndiscovery.",

However, existing systems face challenges such\nas data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and\nbuilding levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal\nstrength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic\ncontrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical\nfoundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the\nprobabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation,\nand resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs.\nLeveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate\nstrong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data\ndiversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for\nrobust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention\n(STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention\nmechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data.\nFurthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture\nforward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust\nrepresentations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc\ndatasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled\ndata and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and\nmeasurement noise.

    "summary": "The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated\nelectrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and\ncomputational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful\napproach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the\ncorrelated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to\ncalculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for\nDMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It\nleverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian\nsubspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth\nquantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute\nGreen's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using\nthe Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability\nof circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM\nquantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8\nqubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum\ncomputing use case in materials science.",

    "summary": "As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime,\nquantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and\nenabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits\nwill initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks\nlike magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient\nmethods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle\nrotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these\nconstraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an\napproach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error\nmitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded\nmagic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the\n2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD\noutperforms the Ross-Selinger gate synthesis method [Quantum Inf.\\ Comp.\\\n\\textbf{16}, 901-953 (2016), arXiv:1403.2975] in the number of noisy encoded\nmagic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \\times 8$. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage which is\nquantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements\nfor small-angle rotations over classical simulators.

Furthermore, we extend the entanglement-assisted circuit\nknitting framework to the black-box setting, which can be applicable to the\ncircuit knitting of quantum combs.

On the other\nhand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings\nand demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups\nunder certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti\nnumbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity\nand holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of\ntopological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of\nhomology that can reveal richer structural information.

    "summary": "Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form\n$\\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for\n\\textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to\nexisting quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known\nabout \\textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it\nchallenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In\nthis work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum\ndifferential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation\n(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a\nunitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make\nseveral algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization\nbounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme\nfor the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for\noblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art\nby at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if\nstate preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous\nresource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the\nmost general case whereby the dynamics are not \\textit{fast-forwardable}, these\nfindings provide a 100-200x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis\ncontributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum\ncomputing.",

This paper presents QARMA, a novel\nQubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for\nModular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that\nincorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an\nattention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal\nqubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core\ncommunications.

Our experimental results show significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular\narchitecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to\n100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger\ncircuits without reuse.

In this work, we quantitatively investigate\nthe performance and gate counts of double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs)\nfor ground state preparation. We propose a practical strategy in which DBQAs\nrefine initial state preparation circuits, and we compile them for Heisenberg\nchains using controlled-Z and single-qubit gates. Warm-started DBQAs\nconsistently improve both the energy and ground-state fidelity relative to the\ninitial states provided by variational ans\\\"atze, indicating that DBQAs offer\nan effective unitary synthesis method. To demonstrate compatibility with\nnear-term hardware, we executed a proof-of-concept example on IBM devices. With\nerror mitigation, we observed a statistically significant improvement over the\ncorresponding warm-start circuit. Furthermore, numerical emulations for the\nsame system size indicate that executing DBQAs on Quantinuum's hardware could\nachieve similar cost-function gains without requiring error mitigation.

In this work, we\nintroduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's\ncapability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum\nprogramming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task\nis fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key\ncontributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features\nof quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for\nquantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3\ntask suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation\nand verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive\nreasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training\ndataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several\ninteresting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error\npatterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning.

    "summary": "Protocols for quantum measurement are an essential part of quantum computing.\nMeasurements are no longer confined to the final step of computation but are\nincreasingly embedded within quantum circuits as integral components of\nnoise-resilient algorithms. However, each observable typically requires a\ndistinct measurement basis, often demanding a different circuit configuration.\nAs the number of such configurations typically grows with the number of qubits,\ndifferent measurement configurations constitute a major bottleneck. Focusing on\nelectronic structure calculations in crystalline systems, we propose a\nmeasurement protocol that maximally reduces the number of measurement settings\nto just three, independent of the number of qubits. This makes it one of the\nfew known protocols that do not scale with qubit number. In particular, we\nderive the measurement protocol from the symmetries of tight-binding (TB)\nHamiltonians and implement it within the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD)\nalgorithm. We demonstrate its performance on two systems, namely a\ntwo-dimensional CuO$_2$ square lattice (3 qubits) and bilayer graphene (4\nqubits). The protocol can be generalized to more complex many-body Hamiltonians\nwith high symmetry, providing a potential path toward future demonstrations of\nquantum advantage.",

    "summary": "Next Generation (NG) networks move beyond simply connecting devices to creating an ecosystem of connected intelligence, especially with the support of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computation. These systems are expected to handle large-scale deployments and high-density networks with diverse functionalities. As a result, there is an increasing demand for efficient and intelligent algorithms that can operate under uncertainty from both propagation environments and networking systems. Traditional optimization methods often depend on accurate theoretical models of data transmission, but in real-world NG scenarios, they suffer from high computational complexity in large-scale settings. Stochastic Optimization (SO) algorithms, designed to accommodate extremely high density and extensive network scalability, have emerged as a powerful solution for optimizing wireless networks. This includes various categories that range from model-based approaches to learning-based approaches. These techniques are capable of converging within a feasible time frame while addressing complex, large-scale optimization problems. However, there is currently limited research on SO applied for NG networks, especially the upcoming Sixth-Generation (6G). In this survey, we emphasize the relationship between NG systems and SO by eight open questions involving the background, key features, and lesson learned. Overall, our study starts by providing a detailed overview of both areas, covering fundamental and widely used SO techniques, spanning from single to multi-objective signal processing. Next, we explore how different algorithms can solve NG challenges, such as load balancing, optimizing energy efficiency, improving spectral efficiency, or handling multiple performance trade-offs. Lastly, we highlight the challenges in the current research and propose new directions for future studies.",

In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.",

Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem.

Previous studies have uncovered explicit rational function formulas for moments of purity statistic (trace of the squared density matrix), and also a third order linear differential equation satisfied by the eigenvalue density. We further probe the origin of these results from the viewpoint of integrability, which is taken here to mean wider classes of recursions and differential equations, and give extensions. Prominent in our study are first order linear matrix differential equations. One application given is to the derivation of the third order scalar equation for the density. Another is to obtain the explicit rational function formula for the variance of the purity statistic in the $β$ generalised fixed trace Laguerre ensemble. In the original case ($β= 2$), the purity cumulants are expressed in terms of the large argument expansion of a particular $σ$-Painlevé IV transcendent. In a different but related direction, the exact computation of the two-point correlation for the fixed determinant circular unitary ensemble SU$(N)$ is given the Appendix.",

The proposed approach is demonstrated through a progression of problems drawn from standard undergraduate curricula, including the derivation of Snell's law from Fermat's principle, projectile motion with and without viscous drag, simple harmonic motion, nonlinear pendulum with damping, steady-state heat conduction governed by the Laplace and Poisson equations with nonlinear temperature-dependent internal heat generation, the double pendulum via the principle of least action, and variational treatments of vibrating strings. In addition, quantum mechanical applications are presented through variational solutions of the hydrogen atom, helium atom, and a schematic nuclear model of the silicon nucleus, illustrating the breadth of the framework across classical, quantum, and nuclear physics.

    "summary": "As quantum systems scale, Multiprogramming Quantum Computing (MPQC) becomes essential to improve device utilization and throughput. However, current MPQC pipelines rely on expensive online compilation to co-optimize concurrently running programs, because quantum executables are device-dependent, non-portable across qubit regions, and highly susceptible to noise and crosstalk. This online step dominates runtime and impedes low-latency deployments for practical, real-world workloads in the future, such as repeatedly invoked Quantum Neural Network (QNN) services.\n  We present FLAMENCO, a fidelity-aware multi-version compilation system that enables independent offline compilation and low-latency, high-fidelity multiprogramming at runtime. At the architecture level, FLAMENCO abstracts devices into compute units to drastically shrink the search space of region allocation. At compile time, it generates diverse executable versions for each program -- each bound to a distinct qubit region -- allowing dynamic region selection at runtime and overcoming non-portability. At runtime, FLAMENCO employs a streamlined orchestrator that leverages post-compilation fidelity metrics to avoid conflicts and mitigate crosstalk, achieving reliable co-execution without online co-optimization. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art MPQC baselines show that FLAMENCO removes online compilation overhead, achieves over 5$\\times$ runtime speedup, improves execution fidelity, and maintains high utilization as concurrency increases.",

Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices.",

    "summary": "Light harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a primary component of the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria that is responsible for harvesting and relaying excitons. The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.",

While significant progress has been made in DQC for quantum circuit models, there exists much less research on DQC for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), which is a universal quantum computing model that is essentially different from the circuit model and particularly well-suited to photonic quantum platforms. In this paper, we propose DC-MBQC, the first distributed quantum compilation framework tailored for MBQC. We identify and address two key challenges in enabling DQC for MBQC. First, for task allocation among quantum processing units (QPUs), we develop an adaptive graph partitioning algorithm that preserves the structure of the graph state while balancing the workload across QPUs. Second, for inter-QPU communication, we introduce the layer scheduling problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Regrading realistic hardware requirements, we optimize the execution time of running quantum programs and the corresponding required photon lifetime to avoid fatal failures caused by photon loss. Our experiments demonstrate a $7.46\\times$ improvement on required photon lifetime and $6.82\\times$ speedup with 8 fully-connected QPUs, which further confirm the advantage of distributed quantum computing in photonic systems.

ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3).

By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity.

For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.",

Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.",

Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries.",

    "summary": "Quantum simulations of many-body systems offer novel methods for probing the dynamics of the Standard Model and its constituent gauge theories. Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez. The quantum results match classical predictions at the percent-level. This work lays out a path forward for two- and three-dimensional simulations of larger systems, as well as demonstrating the viability of mixed-basis formulations for studying the properties of SU(2) gauge theories at all values of the gauge coupling.",

While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.",

Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.",

Although error magnitudes are frequently quantified, the specific physical effects of quantum noise on flow simulation results remain largely uncharacterized. We investigate the influence of gate noise on the quantum simulation of one-dimensional scalar convection. By employing a quantum spectral algorithm where ideal time advancement affects only Fourier phases, we isolate and analyze noise-induced artifacts in spectral magnitudes. We derive a theoretical transition matrix based on Hamming distances between computational basis states to predict spectral decay, and then validate this model against density-matrix simulations and experiments on a superconducting quantum processor. Furthermore, using data-driven sparse regression, we demonstrate that quantum noise manifests in the effective partial differential equation primarily as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms.

    "summary": "A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.",

Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts.

    "summary": "Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $α_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = α_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $Δ_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $Δμ$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.",

In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck.

The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which \"the Fourier component\" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing exploits the properties of Quantum Mechanics to solve problems faster than classical computers. The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements. Finally, we used the Quantum Fourier Transform as an energetic benchmark, comparing the scaling we obtained to that of the execution of the Discrete Fourier Transform in two state-of-the-art classical supercomputers.",

Using an explicit spectral decomposition together with an elementary doubling lemma, we show that $r$ can be recovered from a single heat-kernel value after at most $O((\\log_2 N)^2)$ diffusion steps, with an effective bound.\n  We then combine this order-finding model with the standard reduction from factoring to order finding (in the spirit of Shor's framework) to obtain a randomized factorization procedure whose success probability depends only on the number $m$ of distinct prime factors of $N$. Our comparison with Shor's algorithm is \\emph{conceptual and model-based}.

Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations.",

FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \\textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.",

We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.",

PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.",

The construction is asymptotic: it treats a neighborhood of infinity, and is meant to couple to interior solvers via domain decomposition. The method provides far-field data without relying on explicit solutions or Green's function representation. Scattering in variable media is treated in a unified framework where both the incident and scattered fields solve the same background Helmholtz operator. Numerical experiments for constant, short-range, and long-range media with single-mode and Gaussian beam incidence demonstrate spectral convergence of the computed scattering amplitudes in all cases.",

    "summary": "We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.",

    "summary": "This work introduces an end-to-end framework for multi-asset option pricing that combines market-consistent risk-neutral density recovery with quantum-accelerated numerical integration. We first calibrate arbitrage-free marginal distributions from European option quotes using the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) model, leveraging its analytical tractability and ability to capture skewness and fat tails. Marginals are coupled via a Gaussian copula to construct joint distributions. To address the computational bottleneck of the high-dimensional integration required to solve the option pricing formula, we employ Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) techniques based on Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), achieving quadratic convergence improvements over classical Monte Carlo (CMC) methods. Theoretical results establish accuracy bounds and query complexity for both marginal density estimation (via cosine-series expansions) and multidimensional pricing. Empirical tests on liquid equity entities (Credit Agricole, AXA, Michelin) confirm high calibration accuracy and demonstrate that QAMC requires 10-100 times fewer queries than classical methods for comparable precision. This study provides a practical route to integrate arbitrage-aware modelling with quantum computing, highlighting implications for scalability and future extensions to complex derivatives.",

Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.",

    "summary": "Verdazyl radicals are a versatile class of air-stable organic radicals used in various applications, especially for their magnetic properties. Despite the development of a wide range of verdazyl derivatives, however, they are all non-emissive. To investigate the reasons behind this and to understand the excited-state dynamics of verdazyls, we combine steady-state and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations. In the carbazole-substituted 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl (TPV-Cz) , we observe ultrafast internal conversion of the first excited state on a timescale of 0.5 $\\pm$ 0.1 ps, followed by vibrational relaxation with a lifetime of 3.7 $\\pm$ 0.4 ps. Spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal that the sub-picosecond non-radiative decay comes from a low-energy conical intersection between the D1 and D0 states, driven by an out-of-plane distortion of the verdazyl ring. This distortion is observed and remains energetically accessible in the isolated verdazyl ring in 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl and in TPV-Cz. This shows that the conical intersection geometry is a recurring feature across different types of verdazyl derivatives and explains why all verdazyls are non-emissive despite different functionalization. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the photophysical properties of verdazyl radicals and offers a pathway for the future design of emissive verdazyl derivatives.",

    "summary": "Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.",

By coupling this bath to a target system prior to relaxation, useful thermodynamic tasks can be performed, enabling performance beyond conventional thermodynamic limits. As an application, we analyze information erasure and derive the resulting gain analytically. We further demonstrate the framework by implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on IBM's superconducting quantum processor. Despite substantial noise and errors in current hardware, our method achieves erasure with heat dissipation below the Landauer limit. These results establish a practical connection between quantum computing and quantum thermodynamics and suggest a route toward reducing thermodynamic costs in future large-scale quantum computers.",

For this, entangled states of high quality and rate must be distributed. Currently, two main types of entanglement distribution protocols exist, namely emission-based and scattering-based, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\\approx 0.16\\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates. Furthermore, we introduce protocols that completely eliminate the need for memory-based two-qubit gates, achieving thresholds of $\\approx 0.19\\%$ with modest hardware enhancements, increasing to above $\\approx 0.24\\%$ with photon-number-resolving detectors.

To maximize the Petz-Rényi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex Hölder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024).",

However, since non-local gates acting on different Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are a bottleneck, it is crucial to optimize the qubit assignment to minimize inter-node entanglement of the shared resource. For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary. We show that the approach is highly effective for determining qubit assignments in distributed MBQC by testing it on grid graphs and the measurement-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).",

    "summary": "Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( https://github.com/bsc-quantic/HadaMAG.jl/ ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.",

Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.",

    "summary": "We present systematic and resource-efficient constructions of continuous symmetry projectors, particularly $U(1)$ particle number and $SU(2)$ total spin, tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computations. Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates. These results establish continuous-symmetry projectors as practical and scalable tools for state preparation in quantum chemistry and provide a pathway toward realizing more efficient fault-tolerant quantum simulations.",

Designing and verifying such architectures requires a unified formalism that integrates linear algebraic reasoning with probabilistic and control-flow structures. In this work, we introduce a graphical framework for distributed quantum computing that brings together linear optics, the ZX-calculus, and dataflow programming. Our language supports the formal analysis and optimization of distributed protocols involving both qubits and photonic modes, with explicit interfaces for classical control and feedforward, all expressed within a synchronous dataflow model with discrete-time dynamics. Within this setting, we classify entangling photonic fusion measurements, show how their induced Pauli errors can be corrected via a novel flow structure for fusion networks, and establish correctness proofs for new repeat-until-success protocols enabling arbitrary fusions. Layer by layer, we construct qubit architectures incorporating practical optical components such as beam splitters, switches, and photon sources, with graphical proofs that they are deterministic and support universal quantum computation. Together, these results establish a foundation for verifiable compilation and automated optimization in networked quantum computing.",

Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.",

Using the Metric-Noise-Resource methodology, we establish a quantitative connection between experimental control parameters, dominant noise processes, and energetic resources through a performance metric tailored to Boson Sampling. We estimate the energy cost per sample and identify operating regimes that optimize energetic efficiency. By comparing the energy consumption of quantum and state-of-the-art classical implementations, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum energetic advantage -- defined as a lower energy cost per sample compared to the best-known classical implementation -- that emerges before the onset of computational advantage, even in regimes where classical algorithms remain faster. Finally, we propose an experimentally feasible Boson Sampling architecture, including a complete noise and loss budget, that enables a near-term observation of quantum energetic advantage.",

Part 1 develops the backbone (essential linear algebra, the Bloch-sphere viewpoint, differential-geometric intuition, and quantum Fisher information geometry) so evolution can be read as motion on curved spaces and measurement as statistics. Part 2 reframes circuits as dataflow graphs: measurement outcomes are parsed, aggregated, and reduced to small linear-algebra updates that schedule the next pulses, highlighting why low-latency, low-jitter streaming matters. Part 3 treats multi-qubit structure and entanglement as geometry and computation, including teleportation, superdense coding, entanglement detection, and Shor's algorithm via quantum phase estimation. Part 4 focuses on topological error correction and real-time decoding (Track A): stabilizer codes, surface-code decoding as \"topology -> graph -> algorithm\", and Union-Find decoders down to microarchitectural/RTL constraints, with verification, fault injection, and host/control-stack integration under product metrics (bounded latency, p99 tails, fail-closed policies, observability). Optional Track C covers quantum cryptography and streaming post-processing (BB84/E91, QBER/abort rules, privacy amplification, and zero-knowledge/post-quantum themes), emphasizing FSMs, counters, and hash pipelines. Appendices provide visualization-driven iCEstick labs (switch-to-bit conditioning, fixed-point phase arithmetic, FSM sequencing, minimal control ISAs), bridging principles to implementable systems.",

    "summary": "In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.",

However, a major consequence of this is AI displacing employees from their jobs, leading to feelings of job insecurity and uncertainty.

To investigate this, we performed semi-structured interviews with (n = 25) students across computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the University of Toronto to determine the extent of job replacement anxiety. Through thematic analysis, it was determined that computer science students indeed face stress and anxiety from AI displacement of jobs, leading to different strategies of managing pressure. Subfields such as software engineering and web development are strongly believed to be vulnerable to displacement, while specialized subfields like quantum computing and AI research are deemed more secure. Many students feel compelled to upskill by using more AI technologies, taking AI courses, and specializing in AI through graduate school. Some students also reskill by pursuing other fields of study seen as less vulnerable to AI displacement. Finally, international students experience additional job replacement anxiety because of pressure to secure permanent residence. Implications of these findings include feelings of low security in computer science careers, oversaturation of computer science students pursuing AI, and potential dissuasion of future university students from pursuing computer science.",

Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.",

    "summary": "Quantum Computing (QC) has evolved from a few custom quantum computers, which were only accessible to their creators, to an array of commercial quantum computers that can be accessed on the cloud by anyone. Accessing these cloud quantum computers requires a complex chain of tools that facilitate connecting, programming, simulating algorithms, estimating resources, submitting quantum computing jobs, retrieving results, and more. Some steps in the chain are hardware dependent and subject to change as both hardware and software tools, such as available gate sets and optimizing compilers, evolve. Understanding the trade-offs inherent in this process is essential for evaluating the power and utility of quantum computers. ARLIS has been systematically investigating these environments to understand these complexities. The work presented here is a detailed summary of three months of using such quantum programming environments. We show metadata obtained from these environments, including the connection metrics to the different services, the execution of algorithms, the testing of the effects of varying the number of qubits, comparisons to simulations, execution times, and cost. Our objective is to provide concrete data and insights for those who are exploring the potential of quantum computing. It is not our objective to present any new algorithms or optimize performance on any particular machine or cloud platform; rather, this work is focused on providing a consistent view of a single algorithm executed using out-of-the-box settings and tools across machines, cloud platforms, and time. We present insights only available from these carefully curated data.",

Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.",

In this context, a Root of Trust (RoT) establishes a trusted environment, where both data and code are authenticated via a digital signature based on asymmetric cryptography, which is vulnerable to the threat posed by Quantum Computers (QCs). Firmware, being the first layer of trusted software, faces unique risks due to its longevity and difficult update. The transition of firmware protection to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is urgent, since it reduces the risk derived from exposing all computing and network devices to quantum-based attacks. This paper offers an analysis of the most common trust techniques and their roadmap towards a Post-Quantum (PQ) world, by investigating the current status of PQC and the challenges posed by such algorithms in existing Trusted Computing (TC) solutions from an integration perspective. Furthermore, this paper proposes an architecture for TC techniques enhanced with PEC, addressing the imperative for immediate adoption of quantum-resistant algorithms.",

    "summary": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.",

Our previous work demonstrated that our QNN learns patterns in gravitational wave (GW) data much faster than a classical neural network, making it suitable for fast GW signal detection in future LISA data streams.

This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves.",

By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.",

    "summary": "Database systems encompass several performance-critical optimization tasks, such as join ordering and index tuning. As data volumes grow and workloads become more complex, these problems have become exponentially harder to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, especially quantum annealing, is a promising paradigm that can efficiently explore very large search spaces through quantum tunneling. It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality.\n  In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan. Q2O is capable of handling actual queries in real time.",

However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised.",

    "summary": "Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.",

In this work, we initiate the study of computational quantum capacities. These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.",

Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process. Looking ahead, we speculate on the developmental pathways for lithium niobate platforms and their potential to revolutionize areas such as quantum communication, complex system simulation, quantum sampling, and optical quantum computing paradigms.",

We show it is possible to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ state by using two carefully chosen wavelengths (with comparable tensor light shift magnitude and opposite sign) at an appropriate intensity ratio, thus suppressing light-shift induced dephasing, enabling scalar magic conditions between the ground state and $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$, and tensor magic conditions for qudits encoded within it. Furthermore, this technique enables robust operation at the tensor magic angle 54.7$^\\circ$ with linear trap polarization via reduced sensitivity to uncertainty in experimental parameters. We expect this technique to enable new loading protocols, enhance cooling efficiency, and enhance nuclear spins' coherence times, thus facilitating qudit-based quantum computing in ${}^{87}$Sr in the $5s5p$ $\\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ manifold.",

Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.",

This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary \"kick\" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.",

    "summary": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error-correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.",

    "summary": "Standard approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) require active maintenance using measurements and classical processing. The possibility of passive QEC has so far only been established in an unphysical number of spatial dimensions. In this work, we present a simple method for autonomous QEC in two spatial dimensions, formulated as a quantum cellular automaton with a fixed, local and translation-invariant update rule. The construction uses hierarchical, self-simulating control elements based on the classical schemes from the seminal results of Gács (1986, 1989) together with a measurement-free concatenated code. We analyze the system under a local noise model and prove a noise threshold below which the logical errors are suppressed arbitrarily with increasing system size and the memory lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The scheme admits a continuous-time implementation as a time-independent, translation-invariant local Lindbladian with engineered dissipative jump operators. Further, the recursive nature of our protocol allows for the fault-tolerant encoding of arbitrary quantum circuits and thus constitutes a self-correcting universal quantum computer.",

    "summary": "Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing is entering a period in which progress will be shaped as much by advances in computer science as by improvements in hardware. The central thesis of this report is that early fault-tolerant quantum computing shifts many of the primary bottlenecks from device physics alone to computer-science-driven system design, integration, and evaluation. While large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain a long-term objective, near- and medium-term systems will support early fault-tolerant computation with small numbers of logical qubits and tight constraints on error rates, connectivity, latency, and classical control. How effectively such systems can be used will depend on advances across algorithms, error correction, software, and architecture. This report identifies key research challenges for computer scientists and organizes them around these four areas, each centered on a fundamental question.",
