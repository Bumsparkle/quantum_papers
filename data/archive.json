    "summary": "Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the\npotential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are\nparamount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and\nhandcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce\n\\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework\nfor automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks\n(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits\nsequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward\nfunction that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,\nand gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse\nensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of\nsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz\ndesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image\nclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits\ndesigned by \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding\ncircuits that are 10$\\times$-30$\\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,\ngates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without\ncompromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles\nfrom real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of\ngenerative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum\ncircuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum\nalgorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.",

Such\nsimulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical\nto advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and\nmaterials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to\nclean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of\nall previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods,\nand it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale\nquantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we\nimplement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System\nModel H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit\nsystem that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the\nperiodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge\nseparation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the\nlimited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical\nsimulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum\ndevice. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the\neffective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between\ncharge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by\nclassical tensor network methods.

    "summary": "An $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gate is mainly utilized to construct other quantum\ngates and operators, such as Fredkin gates, arithmetical adders, and logical\ncomparators, where $n \\geq 2$. Several researchers introduced different methods\nto decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates in a quantum circuit into a set of\nstandard 3-bit Toffoli gates or a set of elementary quantum gates, such as\nsingle-qubit and two-qubit gates. However, these methods are not effectively\nreconfigurable for linearly connected symmetrical structures (layouts) of\ncontemporary quantum computers, usually utilizing more ancilla qubits. This\npaper introduces a new structural design method to effectively decompose\n$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates by utilizing configurable ancilla qubits, which we\nnamed the ``support qubits\". Collectively, we call our decomposition method for\nsymmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures\nshaped operators (Stesso)\". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable\nconstruct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate\nsub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and\nGeneralized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that\n$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using\nconventional composition methods.",

Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,\nlong readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.\nReducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors\nthat accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected\nphotons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves\nneutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but\nunreliable readout.\n  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,\nGANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear\nsignals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification\nat up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and\na pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up\nto 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art\nCNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.",

    "summary": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) protects qubits against bit- and phase-flip\nerrors in the |0> or |1> subspace, but physical qubits can also leak into\nhigher energy levels (e.g., |2>). Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts\nall subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits.\nDetecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are\nnever measured directly during QEC cycles. Prior work, such as eraser,\naddresses this by inferring leakage from syndrome patterns using a fixed\nheuristic. However, this approach often misclassifies benign syndromes,\ntriggering excessive leakage-reduction circuits (LRCs). Because LRCs are\nthemselves noisy and slow, these false triggers lengthen QEC cycles and inflate\nlogical error rates.\n  We propose gladiator, a general and adaptable leakage speculation framework\nthat works across surface code, color code, and qLDPC codes. Offline, gladiator\nbuilds a code-aware error-propagation graph calibrated to device data. Online,\nit classifies each syndrome in a few nanoseconds and schedules LRC only when\nthe observed pattern is provably leakage-dominated. This precise speculation\neliminates up to 3x (and on average 2x) unnecessary LRCs, shortens QEC cycles,\nand suppresses false positives at their source. Evaluated on standard\nfault-tolerant benchmarks, gladiator delivers 1.7x-3.9x speedups and 16%\nreduction in logical error rate, advancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant\nquantum computing.",

These are used as\ninputs to a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that discriminates known\ndriver genes from others. Simulations on an empirical PPI network demonstrate\ncompetitive performance, with a 12.6% recall gain over a classical baseline.\nThe pipeline performs explicit quantum state preparation and requires no\nclassical training, enabling an efficient, nearly end-to-end quantum workflow.\nA brief complexity analysis suggests the approach could achieve a quantum\nspeedup in network-based cancer gene prediction. This work underscores the\npotential of supervised quantum graph learning frameworks to advance biological\ndiscovery.",

However, existing systems face challenges such\nas data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and\nbuilding levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal\nstrength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic\ncontrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical\nfoundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the\nprobabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation,\nand resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs.\nLeveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate\nstrong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data\ndiversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for\nrobust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention\n(STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention\nmechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data.\nFurthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture\nforward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust\nrepresentations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc\ndatasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled\ndata and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and\nmeasurement noise.

    "summary": "The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated\nelectrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and\ncomputational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful\napproach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the\ncorrelated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to\ncalculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for\nDMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It\nleverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian\nsubspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth\nquantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute\nGreen's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using\nthe Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability\nof circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM\nquantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8\nqubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum\ncomputing use case in materials science.",

    "summary": "As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime,\nquantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and\nenabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits\nwill initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks\nlike magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient\nmethods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle\nrotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these\nconstraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an\napproach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error\nmitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded\nmagic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the\n2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD\noutperforms the Ross-Selinger gate synthesis method [Quantum Inf.\\ Comp.\\\n\\textbf{16}, 901-953 (2016), arXiv:1403.2975] in the number of noisy encoded\nmagic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \\times 8$. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage which is\nquantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements\nfor small-angle rotations over classical simulators.

Furthermore, we extend the entanglement-assisted circuit\nknitting framework to the black-box setting, which can be applicable to the\ncircuit knitting of quantum combs.

On the other\nhand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings\nand demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups\nunder certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti\nnumbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity\nand holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of\ntopological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of\nhomology that can reveal richer structural information.

    "summary": "Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form\n$\\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for\n\\textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to\nexisting quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known\nabout \\textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it\nchallenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In\nthis work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum\ndifferential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation\n(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a\nunitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make\nseveral algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization\nbounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme\nfor the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for\noblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art\nby at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if\nstate preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous\nresource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the\nmost general case whereby the dynamics are not \\textit{fast-forwardable}, these\nfindings provide a 100-200x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis\ncontributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum\ncomputing.",

This paper presents QARMA, a novel\nQubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for\nModular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that\nincorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an\nattention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal\nqubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core\ncommunications.

Our experimental results show significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular\narchitecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to\n100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger\ncircuits without reuse.

We then examine networks of states\nwhere multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications,\nwe first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there\nis minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave\ncoupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence\ninduced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for\nquantum computation applications.",

In\nrecent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work\nfrom an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures\nthat are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be\nrestrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong\ncollective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum\nsimulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by\nevaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of\ninteractions or by measuring suitable local observables only.

We demonstrate its applicability to realistic\nphysical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model,\nand the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile\ntool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.",

However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that\na generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native\noperations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels\nin a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each\nother due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a\nsignificant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may\nintroduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to\ndecompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed\nby qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses\nis at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific\noperations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses.

Quantum computing offers a promising\nsolution to overcome these challenges.

Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce\ncolor-neutrality constraints.
