* **Abstract:** Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.

* **Abstract:** We develop a workflow within the ONIOM framework and demonstrate it on the hybrid computing system consisting of the supercomputer Fugaku and the Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer. This hybrid platform extends the layered approach for biomolecular chemical reactions to accurately treat the active site, such as a protein, and the large and often weakly correlated molecular environment. Our result marks a significant milestone in enabling scalable and accurate simulation of complex biomolecular reactions

### A Computational Companion to Transient de Sitter and Quasi de Sitter States in SO(32) and E_8 X E_8 Heterotic String Theories I: Formalisms

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15489v1
* **Abstract:** We construct four-dimensional de Sitter space as an excited state, rather than as a vacuum configuration, in type IIB, heterotic SO(32), and heterotic E_8 \times E_8 string theories. This framework provides a mechanism to evade vacuum-based no-go theorems for de Sitter solutions in string theory. Starting from a generic M-theory configuration, we obtain de Sitter isometry in the dual string theories through appropriate dynamical duality sequences in the late-time limit. The excited state, identified as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, is constructed as the expectation value of the metric operator in M-theory using path-integral techniques.   We further analyze the conditions required for the existence of a well-defined effective field theory description and show that these conditions are equivalent to the Null Energy Condition for a (3+1)-dimensional FLRW cosmology. Finally, we investigate constraints arising from axionic cosmology and demonstrate how the time-dependent solutions are modified when experimental bounds on the axionic coupling constant are taken into account.   This article serves as a computational companion to sections 3 and 4 of the paper https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.03798.

### The computational two-way quantum capacity

* **Abstract:** Quantum channel capacities are fundamental to quantum information theory. Their definition, however, does not limit the computational resources of sender and receiver. In this work, we initiate the study of computational quantum capacities. These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.
