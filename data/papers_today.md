* **Abstract:** We study canonical basis elements in higher-level Fock spaces associated with the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_\infty)$, which are conjecturally related to Calogero-Moser theory for complex reflection groups. We generalize the Leclerc-Miyachi formula to arbitrary levels by introducing new explicit constructions based on symbols, including a column removal theorem and closed formulas in several cases. These results provide explicit descriptions of canonical basis elements with applications to Calogero-Moser cellular characters and to the decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras.

* **Abstract:** Developing high-performance materials is critical for diverse energy applications to increase efficiency, improve sustainability and reduce costs. Classical computational methods have enabled important breakthroughs in energy materials development, but they face scaling and time-complexity limitations, particularly for high-dimensional or strongly correlated material systems. Quantum computing (QC) promises to offer a paradigm shift by exploiting quantum bits with their superposition and entanglement to address challenging problems intractable for classical approaches. This perspective discusses the opportunities in leveraging QC to advance energy materials research and the challenges QC faces in solving complex and high-dimensional problems. We present cases on how QC, when combined with classical computing methods, can be used for the design and simulation of practical energy materials. We also outline the outlook for error-corrected, fault-tolerant QC capable of achieving predictive accuracy and quantum advantage for complex material systems.

* **Abstract:** Neutral atoms for quantum computing applications show promise in terms of scalability and connectivity. We demonstrate the realization of a versatile apparatus capable of stochastically loading a 5x5 array of optical tweezers with single $^{88}$Sr atoms featuring flexible magnetic field control and excellent optical access. A custom-designed oven, spin-flip Zeeman slower, and deflection stage produce a controlled flux of Sr directed to the science chamber. In the science chamber, featuring a vacuum pressure of $3 \times 10^{-11}$ mbar, the Sr is cooled using two laser cooling stages, resulting in $\sim 3 \times 10^5$ atoms at a temperature of 5(1) $μ$K. The optical tweezers feature a $1/e^2$ waist of 0.81(2) $μ$m, and loaded atoms can be imaged with a fidelity of $\sim 0.997$ and a survival probability of $0.99^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. The atomic array presented here forms the core of a full-stack quantum computing processor targeted for quantum chemistry computational problems.

* **Abstract:** Quantum technologies have surpassed classical systems by leveraging the unique properties of superposition and entanglement in photons and matter. Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process. Looking ahead, we speculate on the developmental pathways for lithium niobate platforms and their potential to revolutionize areas such as quantum communication, complex system simulation, quantum sampling, and optical quantum computing paradigms.

### Bichromatic Tweezers for Qudit Quantum Computing in ${}^{87}$Sr

* **Abstract:** Neutral atoms have become a competitive platform for quantum metrology, simulation, sensing, and computing. Current magic trapping techniques are insufficient to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits encoded in hyperfine states with $J \neq 0$, compromising qudit coherence. In this paper we propose a scheme to engineer magic trapping conditions for qudits via bichromatic tweezers. We show it is possible to suppress differential light shifts across all magnetic sublevels of the $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ state by using two carefully chosen wavelengths (with comparable tensor light shift magnitude and opposite sign) at an appropriate intensity ratio, thus suppressing light-shift induced dephasing, enabling scalar magic conditions between the ground state and $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$, and tensor magic conditions for qudits encoded within it. Furthermore, this technique enables robust operation at the tensor magic angle 54.7$^\circ$ with linear trap polarization via reduced sensitivity to uncertainty in experimental parameters. We expect this technique to enable new loading protocols, enhance cooling efficiency, and enhance nuclear spins' coherence times, thus facilitating qudit-based quantum computing in ${}^{87}$Sr in the $5s5p$ $\mathrm{^{3}P_2}$ manifold.
