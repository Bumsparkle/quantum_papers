* **Abstract:** Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce \textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth, and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters, gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.

* **Abstract:** Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.

### Stesso: A reconfigurable decomposition of $n$-bit Toffoli gates using symmetrical logical structures and adjustable support qubits

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26116v1
* **Abstract:** An $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gate is mainly utilized to construct other quantum gates and operators, such as Fredkin gates, arithmetical adders, and logical comparators, where $n \geq 2$. Several researchers introduced different methods to decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates in a quantum circuit into a set of standard 3-bit Toffoli gates or a set of elementary quantum gates, such as single-qubit and two-qubit gates. However, these methods are not effectively reconfigurable for linearly connected symmetrical structures (layouts) of contemporary quantum computers, usually utilizing more ancilla qubits. This paper introduces a new structural design method to effectively decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates by utilizing configurable ancilla qubits, which we named the ``support qubits". Collectively, we call our decomposition method for symmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures shaped operators (Stesso)". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable construct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate sub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and Generalized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using conventional composition methods.

### Low-Gap Hf-HfOx-Hf Josephson Junctions for meV-Scale Particle Detection
* **Authors:** Y. Balaji et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2025-10-29

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25203v2
* **Abstract:** Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.

### The Fast for the Curious: How to accelerate fault-tolerant quantum applications
* **Authors:** Sam McArdle et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2025-10-30

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26078v1
* **Abstract:** We evaluate strategies for reducing the run time of fault-tolerant quantum computations, targeting practical utility in scientific or industrial workflows. Delivering a technology with broad impact requires scaling devices, while also maintaining acceptable run times for computations. Optimizing logical clock speed may require moving beyond current strategies, and adopting methods that trade faster run time for increased qubit counts or engineering complexity. We discuss how the co-design of hardware, fault tolerance, and algorithmic subroutines can reduce run times. We illustrate a selection of these topics with resource estimates for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model.

### Overcoming disorder in superconducting globally-driven quantum computing
* **Authors:** Riccardo Aiudi et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2025-10-29
* **Updated:** 2025-10-29
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25996v1
* **Abstract:** We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.

### Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising
* **Authors:** Chaithanya Naik Mude et al.

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982v1
* **Abstract:** Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout. Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement, long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution. Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but unreliable readout.   We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework, GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.

### GHZ-Preserving Gates and Optimized Distillation Circuits
* **Authors:** Mingyuan Wang et al.

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25854v1
* **Abstract:** Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states play a central role in quantum computing and communication protocols, as a typical multipartite entanglement resource. This work introduces an efficient enumeration and simulation method for circuits that preserve and distill noisy GHZ states, significantly reducing the simulation complexity of a gate on $n$ qubits, from exponential $O(2^n)$ for standard state-vector methods or $O(n)$ for Clifford circuits, to a constant $O(1)$ for the method presented here. This method has profound implications for the design of quantum networks, where preservation and purification of entanglement with minimal resource overhead is critical. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the new method in an optimization procedure enabled by the fast simulation, that discovers GHZ distillation circuits far outperforming the state of the art. Fine-tuning to arbitrary noise models is possible as well. We also show that the method naturally extends to graph states that are local Clifford equivalent to GHZ states.

### Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry: towards scalable algorithms on trapped ion quantum computers

* **Abstract:** Due to the wide range of technical applications of actinide elements, a thorough understanding of their electronic structure could complement technological improvements in many different areas. Quantum computing could greatly aid in this understanding, as it can potentially provide exponential speedups over classical approaches, thereby offering insights into the complex electronic structure of actinide compounds. As a first foray into quantum computational chemistry of actinides, this paper compares the method of quantum computed moments (QCM) as a noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithm with a single-ancilla version of quantum phase estimation (QPE), a quantum algorithm expected to run on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We employ these algorithms to study the reaction energetics of plutonium oxides and hydrides. In order to enable quantum hardware experiments, we use several techniques to reduce resource requirements: screening individual Hamiltonian Pauli terms to reduce the measurement requirements of QCM and variational compilation to reduce the depth of QPE circuits. Finally, we derive electronic structure descriptions from a series of representative chemical models and compute the energetics from quantum experiments on Quantinuum's H-series ion trap devices using up to 19 qubits. We find our experiments to be in excellent agreement with results from classical electronic structure calculations and state vector simulations.

### Accurate Leakage Speculation for Quantum Error Correction
* **Authors:** Chaithanya Naik Mude et al.

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25661v1
* **Abstract:** Quantum Error Correction (QEC) protects qubits against bit- and phase-flip errors in the |0> or |1> subspace, but physical qubits can also leak into higher energy levels (e.g., |2>). Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts all subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits. Detecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are never measured directly during QEC cycles. Prior work, such as eraser, addresses this by inferring leakage from syndrome patterns using a fixed heuristic. However, this approach often misclassifies benign syndromes, triggering excessive leakage-reduction circuits (LRCs). Because LRCs are themselves noisy and slow, these false triggers lengthen QEC cycles and inflate logical error rates.   We propose gladiator, a general and adaptable leakage speculation framework that works across surface code, color code, and qLDPC codes. Offline, gladiator builds a code-aware error-propagation graph calibrated to device data. Online, it classifies each syndrome in a few nanoseconds and schedules LRC only when the observed pattern is provably leakage-dominated. This precise speculation eliminates up to 3x (and on average 2x) unnecessary LRCs, shortens QEC cycles, and suppresses false positives at their source. Evaluated on standard fault-tolerant benchmarks, gladiator delivers 1.7x-3.9x speedups and 16% reduction in logical error rate, advancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

### Transition-Aware Decomposition of Single-Qudit Gates

* **Abstract:** Quantum computation with $d$-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$, $^{137}\text{Ba}^+$, $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$, $^{86}\text{Rb}^+$ with different selection rules, and also decomposition for superconducting qudits.
