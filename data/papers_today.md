* **Abstract:** The entanglement distance of evolutionary quantum states of a two-spin system with the XXZ model has been studied. The analysis has been conducted both analytically and using quantum computing. An analytical dependence of the entanglement distance on the values of the model coupling constants and the parameters of the initial states has been obtained. The speed of evolution of a two-spin system has been investigated. The analysis has been performed analytically and using quantum computing. An explicit dependence of the speed of evolution on the coupling constants and on the parameters of the initial state has been obtained. The results of quantum computations are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

* **Abstract:** We study the computation of the $α$-Rényi capacity of a classical-quantum (c-q) channel for $α\in(0,1)$. We propose an exponentiated-gradient (mirror descent) iteration that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our analysis establishes relative smoothness with respect to the entropy geometry, guaranteeing a global sublinear convergence of the objective values. Furthermore, under a natural tangent-space nondegeneracy condition (and a mild spectral lower bound in one regime), we prove local linear (geometric) convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on a truncated probability simplex, with an explicit contraction factor once the local curvature constants are bounded.

* **Abstract:** The emerging widespread usage of AI has led to industry adoption to improve efficiency and increase earnings. However, a major consequence of this is AI displacing employees from their jobs, leading to feelings of job insecurity and uncertainty. This is especially true for computer science students preparing to enter the workforce. To investigate this, we performed semi-structured interviews with (n = 25) students across computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the University of Toronto to determine the extent of job replacement anxiety. Through thematic analysis, it was determined that computer science students indeed face stress and anxiety from AI displacement of jobs, leading to different strategies of managing pressure. Subfields such as software engineering and web development are strongly believed to be vulnerable to displacement, while specialized subfields like quantum computing and AI research are deemed more secure. Many students feel compelled to upskill by using more AI technologies, taking AI courses, and specializing in AI through graduate school. Some students also reskill by pursuing other fields of study seen as less vulnerable to AI displacement. Finally, international students experience additional job replacement anxiety because of pressure to secure permanent residence. Implications of these findings include feelings of low security in computer science careers, oversaturation of computer science students pursuing AI, and potential dissuasion of future university students from pursuing computer science.

### The SpinPulse library for transpilation and noise-accurate simulation of spin qubit quantum computers
* **Authors:** Benoît Vermersch et al.

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10435v1
* **Abstract:** We introduce SpinPulse, an open-source python package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level. SpinPulse models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise. This enables realistic simulations of native gates and quantum circuits, in order to support hardware development. In SpinPulse, a quantum circuit is first transpiled into the native gate set of our model and then converted to a pulse sequence. This pulse sequence is subsequently integrated numerically in the presence of a simulated noisy experimental environment. We showcase workflows including transpilation, pulse-level compilation, hardware benchmarking, quantum error mitigation, and large-scale simulations via integration with the tensor-network library quimb. We expect SpinPulse to be a valuable open-source tool for the quantum computing community, fostering efforts to devise high-fidelity quantum circuits and improved strategies for quantum error mitigation and correction.

### Computing Statistical Properties of Velocity Fields on Current Quantum Hardware

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10166v1
* **Abstract:** Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.

* **Abstract:** Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.

### Three Months in the Life of Cloud Quantum Computing

* **Abstract:** Quantum Computing (QC) has evolved from a few custom quantum computers, which were only accessible to their creators, to an array of commercial quantum computers that can be accessed on the cloud by anyone. Accessing these cloud quantum computers requires a complex chain of tools that facilitate connecting, programming, simulating algorithms, estimating resources, submitting quantum computing jobs, retrieving results, and more. Some steps in the chain are hardware dependent and subject to change as both hardware and software tools, such as available gate sets and optimizing compilers, evolve. Understanding the trade-offs inherent in this process is essential for evaluating the power and utility of quantum computers. ARLIS has been systematically investigating these environments to understand these complexities. The work presented here is a detailed summary of three months of using such quantum programming environments. We show metadata obtained from these environments, including the connection metrics to the different services, the execution of algorithms, the testing of the effects of varying the number of qubits, comparisons to simulations, execution times, and cost. Our objective is to provide concrete data and insights for those who are exploring the potential of quantum computing. It is not our objective to present any new algorithms or optimize performance on any particular machine or cloud platform; rather, this work is focused on providing a consistent view of a single algorithm executed using out-of-the-box settings and tools across machines, cloud platforms, and time. We present insights only available from these carefully curated data.
