* **Abstract:** Mahadev [SIAM J. Comput. 2022] introduced the first protocol for classical verification of quantum computation based on the Learning-with-Errors (LWE) assumption, achieving a 4-message interactive scheme. This breakthrough naturally raised the question of whether fewer messages are possible in the plain model. Despite its importance, this question has remained unresolved.   In this work, we prove that there is no quantum black-box reduction of non-interactive classical verification of quantum computation of $\textsf{QMA}$ to any falsifiable assumption. Here, "non-interactive" means that after an instance-independent setup, the protocol consists of a single message. This constitutes a strong negative result given that falsifiable assumptions cover almost all standard assumptions used in cryptography, including LWE. Our separation holds under the existence of a $\textsf{QMA} \text{-} \textsf{QCMA}$ gap problem. Essentially, these problems require a slightly stronger assumption than $\textsf{QMA}\neq \textsf{QCMA}$. To support the existence of such problems, we present a construction relative to a quantum unitary oracle.

* **Abstract:** Quantum metrology of an incoherent signal is a canonical sensing problem related to superresolution and noise spectroscopy. We show that quantum computing can accelerate searches for a weak incoherent signal when the signal and noise are not precisely known. In particular, we consider weak Schur sampling, density matrix exponentiation, and quantum signal processing for testing the rank, purity, and spectral gap of the unknown quantum state to detect the incoherent signal. We show that these algorithms are faster than full-state tomography, which scales with the dimension of the Hilbert space. We apply our results to detecting exoplanets, stochastic gravitational waves, ultralight dark matter, geontropic quantum gravity, and Pauli noise.
