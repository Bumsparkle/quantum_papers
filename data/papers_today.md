* **Abstract:** Tailoring error correcting codes to the structure of the physical noise can reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hyperbolic Floquet codes use only weight-2 measurements and can be implemented directly on hardware with native pair measurements. We construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations via the Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with the Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm. The $\{10,3\}$ and $\{12,3\}$ families are new to hyperbolic Floquet codes. We evaluate these codes under four noise models: phenomenological, ancilla Entangling Measurement (EM3), Single-step Depolarizing EM3 (SDEM3), and erasure. Under phenomenological noise, specific-logical threshold crossings occur near $p_e \approx 0.3$--$0.5\%$ for $\{8,3\}$ ($k=6$--$56$) and $0.15$--$0.2\%$ for $\{10,3\}$ ($k=12$--$146$). EM3 ancilla noise yields a threshold of ${\sim}1.5\%$ for all three families. SDEM3 is a depolarizing noise model motivated by Majorana tetron architectures; fine-grained codes achieve thresholds of ${\sim}1.0$--$1.2\%$ for all three families. The erasure model captures detected photon loss on spin-optical links; fine-grained codes achieve erasure thresholds of ${\sim}8.5$--$9\%$ for $\{8,3\}$, ${\sim}7$--$8\%$ for $\{10,3\}$, and ${\sim}6.5$--$8\%$ for $\{12,3\}$. Photon loss is the dominant error source in photon-mediated quantum computing. Under the full three-parameter SPOQC-2 noise model, the $\{8,3\}$ codes achieve a 2D fault-tolerant area $2.2\times$ that of the surface code compiled to pair measurements while encoding $k = 10$ logical qubits. In a companion paper, we evaluate the same code families in a distributed setting.

* **Abstract:** Building a useful quantum computer is a grand science and engineering challenge, currently pursued intensely by teams around the world. In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility. We highlight key science and engineering challenges on the road to quantum utility, touching on relevant aspects of our own research.

### Quantified convergence of general homodyne measurements with applications to continuous variable quantum computing

* **Abstract:** In arXiv:2503.00188 we introduced broadband pulsed (BBP) homodyne measurements as a generalization of standard pulsed homodyne quadrature measurements. BBP can take advantage of detectors such as calorimeters that have the potential for high efficiency over a broad spectral range. BBP homodyne retains the advantages of standard pulsed homodyne, enabling measurement of arbitrary quadratures in the limit of large amplitude local oscillators (LO). Here we quantify the convergence of standard and BBP homodyne quadrature measurements to those of the quadrature of interest. We obtain lower bounds on the fidelity of the post-measurement classical-quantum state of outcomes and unmeasured modes, and the fidelity of the states obtained after applying operations conditional on measurement outcomes. The bounds depend on the LO amplitude and the moments of number operators. We demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds by evaluating them for standard pulsed homodyne used for estimating values of the characteristic function of the Wigner distribution, expectations of moments, for quantum teleportation and for continuous variable error correction with GKP codes.

### The challenging task of investigating student thinking: an example from quantum computing

* **Abstract:** Physics education research (PER) studies how students learn physics, yet the nuances of student reasoning can be notoriously difficult to probe even for PER practitioners. This article presents the story of Item 15 on the Quantum Computing Conceptual Survey (QCCS). This assessment item underwent more revision and discussion within the team than the remaining 19 assessment questions combined. This paper provides a behind-the-scenes look at the development of this assessment question: a story that reveals not only interesting findings about student reasoning in quantum computing (specifically, the phenomenon of phase kickback) but provides a cautionary tale for any instructor or researcher attempting to evaluate student reasoning in physics through a multiple-choice test item.

### Numerical Experiments with Parameter Setting of Trotterized Quantum Phase Estimation for Quantum Hamiltonian Ground State Computation

* **Abstract:** We numerically investigate quantum circuit elementary-gate level instantiations of the standard Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm for the task of computing the ground-state energy of a quantum magnet; the disordered fully-connected quantum Heisenberg spin glass model. We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate. This results in strong diminishing returns of optimal phase sampling rates which can occur when the Trotter error is surprisingly high.
