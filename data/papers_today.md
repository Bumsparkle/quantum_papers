* **Abstract:** This book arises from the need to provide a clear and up-to-date overview of the impacts of quantum computing on cryptography. The goal is to provide a reference in Portuguese for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students in the field of data security and cryptography. Throughout the chapters, we present fundamentals, we discuss classical and post-quantum algorithms, evaluate emerging patterns, and point out real-world implementation challenges. The initial objective is to serve as a guide for students, researchers, and professionals who need to understand not only the mathematics involved, but also its practical implications in security systems and policies. For more advanced professionals, the main objective is to present content and ideas so that they can assess the changes and perspectives in the era of quantum cryptographic algorithms. To that end, the text's structure was designed to be progressive: we begin with essential concepts, move on to quantum algorithms and their consequences (with emphasis on Shor's algorithm), present issues focusing on "families" of post-quantum schemes (based on lattices, codes, hash functions, multivariate, isogenies), analyze the state of the art in standardization (highlighting the NIST process), and finally, discuss migration, interoperability, performance, and cryptographic governance. We hope that this work will assist in the formation of critical thinking and informed technical decision-making, fostering secure transition strategies for the post-quantum era.

### Bohr's complementarity principle tested on a real quantum computer via interferometer experiments

* **Abstract:** Bohr's Complementarity Principle is a core concept of quantum mechanics. In this article, an updated complementarity relation for the wave and ondulatory aspects of a quantum system is presented and discussed. Two interferometric experiments are implemented in one and two qubit circuits and executed on real hardware. The final state density matrices are reconstructed using quantum state tomography and the complementarity relation is tested via direct computation. Results of the executions are presented both graphically and with a mean squared error analysis for a better comprehension.

### Differentiable Architecture Search for Adversarially Robust Quantum Computer Vision

* **Abstract:** Current quantum neural networks suffer from extreme sensitivity to both adversarial perturbations and hardware noise, creating a significant barrier to real-world deployment. Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.
