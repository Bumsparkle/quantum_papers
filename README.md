# Automated arXiv Paper Tracker

This repository is my personal, automated paper tracker. It uses a GitHub Action to run a Python script every 24 hours, scraping [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) for new papers that match my interests.

The keywords I'm currently tracking are defined in `config.ini`.
