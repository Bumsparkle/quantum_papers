### AQER: a scalable and efficient data loader for digital quantum computers
* **Authors:** Kaining Zhang et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-02
* **Updated:** 2026-02-02
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02165v1
* **Abstract:** Digital quantum computing promises to offer computational capabilities beyond the reach of classical systems, yet its capabilities are often challenged by scarce quantum resources. A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AQER consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and gate efficiency. Our work paves the way for scalable quantum data processing and real-world quantum computing applications.

* **Authors:** Hui Zhang et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-01-23
* **Updated:** 2026-02-02
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16484v2
* **Abstract:** Quantum technologies have surpassed classical systems by leveraging the unique properties of superposition and entanglement in photons and matter. Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process. Looking ahead, we speculate on the developmental pathways for lithium niobate platforms and their potential to revolutionize areas such as quantum communication, complex system simulation, quantum sampling, and optical quantum computing paradigms.

### Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides
* **Authors:** Alberto Revilla-Peña et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-01-28
* **Updated:** 2026-01-31
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086v2
* **Abstract:** We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.

### Practical Quantum Reservoir Computing in Rydberg Atom Arrays
* **Authors:** Dong-Sheng Liu et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-01-31
* **Updated:** 2026-01-31
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00610v1
* **Abstract:** Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a promising quantum machine learning framework for near-term quantum platforms, yet the performance of different QRC architectures under realistic constraints remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide a comparative numerical study of single-step-QRC (SS-QRC) and multi-step-QRC (MS-QRC) architectures implemented on a Rydberg atom array. We demonstrate that while MS-QRC performance is highly sensitive to the underlying dynamical phase of matter and decoherence, SS-QRC exhibits greater robustness. Using the randomized measurement toolbox to mitigate measurement overhead, we reveal that sampling noise undermines the convergence property required for MS-QRC. This leads to a significant reduction in the information processing capacity (IPC) of MS-QRC, deteriorating its performance on nonlinear time-series benchmarks. In contrast, SS-QRC maintains high IPC and accuracy across both temporal and non-temporal tasks. Our results suggest SS-QRC as a preferred candidate for near-term practical applications due to its resilience to system configurations and statistical noise.

### Lower bounds on non-local computation from controllable correlation
* **Authors:** Richard Cleve et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-01-30
* **Updated:** 2026-01-30
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00255v1
* **Abstract:** Understanding entanglement cost in non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is relevant to complexity, cryptography, gravity, and other areas. This entanglement cost is largely uncharacterized; previous lower bound techniques apply to narrowly defined cases, and proving lower bounds on most simple unitaries has remained open. Here, we give two new lower bound techniques that can be evaluated for any unitary, based on their controllable correlation and controllable entanglement. For Haar random two qubit unitaries, our techniques typically lead to non-trivial lower bounds. Further, we obtain lower bounds on most of the commonly studied two qubit quantum gates, including CNOT, DCNOT, $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$, and the XX interaction, none of which previously had known lower bounds. For the CNOT gate, one of our techniques gives a tight lower bound, fully resolving its entanglement cost. The resulting lower bounds have parallel repetition properties, and apply in the noisy setting.
