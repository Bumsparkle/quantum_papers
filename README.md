### Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation
* **Authors:** Zhengyan Darius Shi et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-06
* **Updated:** 2026-02-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06963v1
* **Abstract:** Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.

### Extensible universal photonic quantum computing with nonlinearity
* **Authors:** Shang Yu et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-06
* **Updated:** 2026-02-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06544v1
* **Abstract:** Universal quantum computing requires an architecture that supports both linear circuits and, crucially, strong nonlinear resources. For quantum photonic systems, integrating such nonlinearities with scalable linear circuitry has been a major bottleneck, leaving most optical experiments without nonlinear operations and, consequently, incapable of achieving universality. Here, we report an extensible photonic computer that supports a universal gate set by seamlessly combining fully programmable, scalable linear optical networks with integrated nonlinear modules. This platform enables a broad range of quantum computing and simulation tasks. We demonstrate the quasi-deterministic generation of optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which are essential resources for bosonic error correction, yet had previously been realized only probabilistically. Furthermore, we simulate complex many-body quantum dynamics, exemplified by the Bose-Hubbard model. Such quantum simulation tasks have long been considered beyond the reach of photonic hardware limited to linear operations. These capabilities, enabled by our extensible architecture, establish a viable route towards photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

### Achieving Sub-Exponential Speedup in Gate-Based Quantum Computing for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
* **Authors:** Ying-Wei Tseng et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-06
* **Updated:** 2026-02-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06420v1
* **Abstract:** Recent quantum-inspired methods based on the Simulated Annealing algorithm have shown strong potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, Grover's algorithm in gate-based quantum computing offers only a quadratic speedup, which remains impractical for large problem sizes. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates Simulated Annealing with Grover's algorithm to achieve sub-exponential speedup, thereby improving its industrial applicability.   In enzyme fermentation, variables such as temperature, stirring, wait time, pH, tryptophan, rice flour and others are encoded by 625 binary parameters, defining the space of possible enzyme formulations. We aim to find a binary configuration that maximizes the active ingredient, formulated as a 625-bit Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem generated from historical experiments and artificial intelligence techniques. Minimizing the QUBO cost corresponds to maximizing the active ingredient. This case study demonstrates that the proposed hybrid method achieves sub-exponential speedup using gate-based quantum computing.

### High-Level Fault-Tolerant Abstractions for Quantum-Gate Circuit Design and Synthesis: PQC and Topological Anyon Architectures (TQC) for Categorical Computations in SU(2)_3 TQFT and D-brane Stability
* **Authors:** Vaidik A Sharma et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-05
* **Updated:** 2026-02-05
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06089v1
* **Abstract:** We propose a dual-architecture quantum simulation framework for modeling morphisms and stability conditions in the bounded derived category $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathrm{Coh}(X))$, with applications to D-brane physics on Kähler and non-Kähler manifolds. Two physically executable quantum realizations are constructed: parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) implemented on conventional gate-based qubit platforms, and a topological quantum computing (TQC) realization using braiding and fusion of Fibonacci anyons modeled via SU(2)$_3$ modular tensor categories.In the PQC model, we encode slope functionals S(F) and stability constraints as variational observables, mapping derived morphisms to unitaries that evolve over parameterized angles. The output expectation values simulate quantum-corrected Chern class inequalities with deformation terms $δ$, capturing quantum corrections to classical geometric stability. In the TQC model, we engineer braid group representations to implement functorial transformations such as spherical twists and autoequivalences as sequences of fault-tolerant braid operations. This bifurcated approach provides a robust engineering pipeline for simulating categorical stability and homological algebra on quantum hardware, bridging abstract derived category theory with executable quantum architectures.
