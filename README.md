* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10092v1
* **Abstract:** Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.

### Computational quantum field theory for fermion pair creation in 2-dimensional curved spacetimes

* **Abstract:** Similarly to the well-known phenomenon of particle / anti-particle pair production in strong electromagnetic fields (the Schwinger effect), the naïve matter field vacuum state can be excited by time-dependent, curved spacetime geometries. This gravitational pair creation corresponds to tunnelling out of a false vacuum. In this work, we study this non-perturbative process using a spacetime resolved numerical approach in the interaction picture. To achieve this, we extend the framework of Computational Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), which allows for efficient numerical time evolution of quantum fields, to spin-$1/2$ fermions in curved spacetime.   Using this extended framework, we investigate vacuum excitation of a Dirac field induced by a spacetime-curvature quench. In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\!+\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.   We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds. While the post-quench geometry considered here is static and no electromagnetic field is included, the present work establishes a foundation for future investigations of particle creation in genuinely time-dependent curved spacetimes and in the presence of electromagnetic backgrounds.

* **Abstract:** Quantum chemistry and materials science are among the most promising areas for demonstrating algorithmic quantum advantage and quantum utility due to their inherent quantum mechanical nature. Still, large-scale simulations of quantum circuits are essential for determining the problem size at which quantum solutions outperform classical methods. In this work, we present a novel hybrid simulation approach, forming a hybrid of a fullstate and a Clifford simulator, specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with the time evolution of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our method focuses on the efficient emulation of multi-qubit rotations, a critical component of Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution. By optimizing the representation and execution of multi-qubit operations leveraging the Pauli frame, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, enabling more efficient simulations. Beyond its impact on chemistry applications, our emulation strategy has broad implications for any computational workload that relies heavily on multi-qubit rotations. By increasing the efficiency of quantum simulations, our method facilitates more accurate and cost-effective studies of complex quantum systems. We quantify the performance improvements and computational savings for this emulation strategy, and we obtain a speedup of a factor $\approx 18$ ($\approx 22$ with MPI) for our evaluated chemistry Hamiltonians with 24 qubits. Thus, we evaluate our integration of this emulation strategy into the Intel Quantum SDK, further bridging the gap between theoretical algorithm development and practical quantum software implementations.

### Efficient circuit compression by multi-qudit entangling gates in linear optical quantum computation
* **Authors:** Apurav et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-09
* **Updated:** 2026-02-09
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08394v1
* **Abstract:** Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in the number of non-local gates. In this Letter, we address this bottleneck by demonstrating the existence of multi-level control-Z (CZ) gates for qudits encoded in multiple spatial modes in LOQC. Unlike conventional two-level CZ gates, which act only on a single pair of modes, multi-level CZ gates impart a conditional phase shift for an arbitrarily chosen subset of the spatial modes. We present two explicit linear optical schemes that realize such operations, illustrating a fundamental trade-off between prior information about the input quantum state and the physical resources required. The first scheme is realized with a constant success probability of $1/8$ independent of the qudit dimension using a single non-local entangling gate, at the cost of state dependence, which is significantly better than the current success probability of $1/9$. Our second scheme provides a fully state independent realization reducing the number of non-local gates to $\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1}+2^{r_2})$ as compared to the existing bound of $\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1+r_2})$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the number of qubits to be removed as control in the qudits. The success probability of the realization is $\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{2^{r_1}+2^{r_2}}$. When combined with qudit circuit compression schemes, our results improve upon a key scalability limitation and significantly improve the efficiency of LOQC architectures.

### High-Level Fault-Tolerant Abstractions for Quantum-Gate Circuit Design and Synthesis: PQC and Topological Anyon Architectures (TQC) for Categorical Computations in SU(2)_3 TQFT and D-brane Stability
* **Authors:** Vaidik A Sharma et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-05
* **Updated:** 2026-02-09
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06089v2
* **Abstract:** We propose a dual-architecture quantum simulation framework for modeling morphisms and stability conditions in the bounded derived category $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathrm{Coh}(X))$, with applications to D-brane physics on Kähler and non-Kähler manifolds. Two physically executable quantum realizations are constructed: parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) implemented on conventional gate-based qubit platforms, and a topological quantum computing (TQC) realization using braiding and fusion of Fibonacci anyons modeled via SU(2)$_3$ modular tensor categories. In the PQC model, we encode slope functionals S(F) and stability constraints as variational observables, mapping derived morphisms to unitaries that evolve over parameterized angles. The output expectation values simulate quantum-corrected Chern class inequalities with deformation terms $δ$, capturing quantum corrections to classical geometric stability. In the TQC model, we engineer braid group representations to implement functorial transformations such as spherical twists and autoequivalences as sequences of fault-tolerant braid operations. This bifurcated approach provides a robust engineering pipeline for simulating categorical stability and homological algebra on quantum hardware, bridging abstract derived category theory with executable quantum architectures.

* **Updated:** 2026-02-08
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07971v1
* **Abstract:** Quantum gates are the essential block for quantum computer. High-dimensional quantum gates exhibit remarkable advantages over their two-dimensional counterparts for some quantum information processing tasks. Here we present a family of entanglement-based optical controlled-SWAP gates on $\mathbb{C}^{2}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$. With the hybrid encoding, we encode the control qubits and target qudits in photonic polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, respectively. The circuit is constructed using only $(2+3d)$ ($d\geq 2$) linear optics, beating an earlier result of 14 linear optics with $d=2$. The circuit depth 5 is much lower than an earlier result of 11 with $d=2$. Besides, the fidelity of the presented circuit can reach 99.4\%, and it is higher than the previous counterpart with $d=2$. Our scheme are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Moreover, our approach allows $d>2$.

### Momentum-Driven Reversible Logic Accelerates Efficient Irreversible Universal Computation
* **Authors:** Kuen Wai Tang et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-07
* **Updated:** 2026-02-07
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07683v1
* **Abstract:** We present implementations of two physically-embedded computation-universal logical operations using a 2-bit logical unit composed of coupled quantum flux parametrons -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits. To illustrate universality, we investigate NAND gates built from these two distinct elementary operations. On the one hand, Controlled Erasure (CE) is designed using fixed-point analysis and assumes that information must be stored in locally-metastable distributions. On the other, Erasure-Flip (EF) leverages momentum as a computational resource and significantly outperforms the metastable approach, simultaneously achieving higher fidelity and faster computational speed without incurring any additional energetic cost. Notably, the momentum degree of freedom allows the EF to achieve universality by using both nontrivial reversible and irreversible logic simultaneously in different logical subspaces. These results not only provide a practical, high-performance protocol ripe for experimental realization but also underscore the broader potential of momentum-based computing paradigms.

### Measurement-Based Preparation of Higher-Dimensional AKLT States and Their Quantum Computational Power

* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-06
* **Updated:** 2026-02-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07201v1
* **Abstract:** We investigate a constant-time, fusion measurement-based scheme to create AKLT states beyond one dimension. We show that it is possible to prepare such states on a given graph up to random spin-1 `decorations', each corresponding to a probabilistic insertion of a vertex along an edge. In investigating their utility in measurement-based quantum computation, we demonstrate that any such randomly decorated AKLT state possesses at least the same computational power as non-random ones, such as those on trivalent planar lattices. For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation. In addition to randomly decorated AKLT states, we also consider random-bond AKLT states, whose construction involves any of the canonical Bell states in the bond degrees of freedom instead of just the singlet in the original construction. Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites. We also argue that these random-bond AKLT states possess similar quantum computational power as the original singlet-bond AKLT states via the percolation perspective.

### Putting fermions onto a digital quantum computer

* **Updated:** 2026-02-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07151v1
* **Abstract:** Quantum computers are expected to become a powerful tool for studying physical quantum systems. Consequently, a number of quantum algorithms for studying the physical properties of such systems have been developed. While qubit-based quantum computers are naturally suited to the study of spin-1/2 systems, systems containing other degrees of freedom must first be encoded into qubits. Transformations to and from fermionic degrees of freedom have long been an important tool in physics and, now the simulation of fermionic systems on quantum computers based on qubits provides yet another application. In this perspective, we review methods for encoding fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits and attempt to dispel the persistent notion that fermionic systems beyond one dimension are fundamentally more difficult to deal with.

### Alleviating Post-Linearization Challenges for Solving Nonlinear Systems on a Quantum Computer

* **Updated:** 2026-02-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07097v1
* **Abstract:** The linearity inherent in quantum mechanics limits current quantum hardware from directly solving nonlinear systems governed by nonlinear differential equations. One can opt for linearization frameworks such as Carleman linearization, which provides a high dimensional infinite linear system corresponding to a finite nonlinear system, as an indirect way of solving nonlinear systems using current quantum computers. We provide an efficient data access model to load this infinite linear representation of the nonlinear system, upto truncation order $N$, on a quantum computer by decomposing the Hamiltonian into the weighted sum of non-unitary operators, namely the Sigma basis. We have shown that the Sigma basis provides an exponential reduction in the number of decomposition terms compared to the traditional decomposition, which is usually done in a linear combination of Pauli operators. Once the Hamiltonian is decomposed, we then use the concept of unitary completion to construct the circuit for the implementation of each weighted tensor product component $\mathcal{H}_{j}$ of the decomposition.
