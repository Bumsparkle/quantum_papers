* **Abstract:** High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes encode many logical qubits in a given number of physical qubits, making them promising candidates for quantum computation. Implementing high-rate codes at a scale that both frustrates classical computing and improves performance by encoding requires both high fidelity gates and long-range qubit connectivity -- both of which are offered by trapped-ion quantum computers. Here, we demonstrate computations that outperform their unencoded counterparts in the high-rate $[[ k+2,\, k,\, 2 ]]$ iceberg quantum error detecting (QED) and $[[ (k_2 + 2)(k_1 + 2),\, k_2k_1,\, 4 ]]$ two-level concatenated iceberg QEC codes, using the 98-qubit Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Utilizing new gadgets for encoded operations, we realize this "beyond break-even" performance with reasonable postselection rates across a range of fault-tolerant (FT) and partially-fault-tolerant (pFT) component and application benchmarks with between $48$ and $94$ logical qubits. These benchmarks include FT state preparation and measurement, QEC cycle benchmarking, logical gate benchmarking, GHZ state preparation, and a pFT quantum simulation of the three-dimensional $XY$ model of quantum magnetism. Additionally, we illustrate that postselection rates can be suppressed by increasing the code distance via concatenation. Our results represent state-of-the-art logical component and state fidelities and provide evidence that high-rate QED/QEC codes are viable on contemporary quantum computers for near-term beyond-classical-scale computation.

* **Abstract:** In the era of big data and the Internet of Things, quantum-level control of conductance states offers a promising route toward high-density data storage and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Although quantum conductance (QC) phenomena have been demonstrated in various metal oxide memristors, achieving reliable and precise control over quantized states remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional quantum conductance states in multifunctional BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite memristors integrated with multilayer-graphene contacts, enabling higher-order tunability and revealing the potential of perovskite-2D heterostructures for quantum-engineered memory and computing devices. XPS analysis provides detailed insights into oxygen vacancy dynamics in BFO, whereas first-principles density functional theory calculations clearly reveal a strong localized electric field at the graphene-BFO interface. Our devices exhibit current-controlled higher-order QC transitions facilitated by quantum point contact formation, giving rise to quantized conductance states during both SET and RESET processes. Time-lag correlation maps quantify the stochastic evolution of QC states under dynamic voltage-pulse tuning schemes. Notably, the quantized conductance states effectively emulate synaptic potentiation and depression, enabling precise weight modulation for high-accuracy image and digit recognition in convolutional neural networks. These findings establish perovskite-2D heterostructures as promising candidates for QC-driven resistive switching and demonstrate their potential for developing controllable quantum memristors.

### Quantum Computing for Query Containment of Conjunctive Queries
* **Authors:** Luisa Gerlach et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-25
* **Updated:** 2026-02-25
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21803v1
* **Abstract:** We address the problem of checking query containment, a foundational problem in database research. Although extensively studied in theory research, optimization opportunities arising from query containment are not fully leveraged in commercial database systems, due to the high computational complexity and sometimes even undecidability of the underlying decision problem. In this article, we present the first approach to applying quantum computing to the query containment problem for conjunctive queries under set semantics. We propose a novel formulation as an optimization problem that can be solved on gate-based quantum hardware, and in some cases directly maps to quantum annealers. We formally prove this formulation to be correct and present a prototype implementation which we evaluate using simulator software as well as quantum devices. Our experiments successfully demonstrate that our approach is sound and scales within the current limitations of quantum hardware. In doing so, we show that quantum optimization can effectively address this problem. Thereby, we contribute a new computational perspective on the query containment problem.

### Experimental and computational studies of the hydrogenation of carbon disulfide (CS2) on ice analogues

* **Abstract:** Carbon disulfide (CS$_2$) is one of the sulfur-bearing species expected to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices. Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions.

### Non-Clifford symmetry protected topological higher-order cluster states in multi-qubit measurement-based quantum computation

* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20612v1
* **Abstract:** A cluster state is a strongly entangled state, which is a source of measurement-based quantum computation. It is generated by applying controlled-Z (CZ) gates to the state $\left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $. It is protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{ \text{odd}}$ symmetry. By applying general quantum gates to the state $ \left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $, we systematically obtain a general short-range entangled cluster state. If we use a non-Clifford gate such as the controlled phase-shift gate, we obtain a non-Clifford cluster state. Furthermore, if we use the controlled-controlled Z (CCZ) gate instead of the CZ gate, we obtain non-Clifford cluster states with five-body entanglement. We generalize it to the C$^{N}$Z gate, where $(2N+1)$-body entangled states are generated. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry is non-Clifford for $N\geq 3$. We demonstrate that there emerge $2^{2N}$ fold degenerate ground states for an open chain, indicating the emergence of $N$ free spins at each edge. They can be used as an $N$-qubit input and an $N$-qubit output in measurement-based quantum computation. We also study the non-invertible symmetry, the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and the string-order parameter in addition to the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry in these models.

### A Unified Error Correction Code for Universal Quantum Computing with Identical Particles
* **Authors:** S. L. Wu et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-24
* **Updated:** 2026-02-24
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20452v1
* **Abstract:** We present a universal fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on identical particle qubits (IPQs), where we find that the first-order IPQ - bath interaction fundamentally differs from the conventional first-order qubit-bath interaction. This key distinction necessitates a redesign of existing strategies to fight decoherence. We propose that the simplest quantum error correction code can be realized directly within the physical qubit, provided that conventional correction and restoration are generalized beyond unitary operations to employ physically implementable reversal operations -- naturally placing logical and physical qubits on equal footing. We further demonstrate that dynamical decoupling (DD) remains effective within this unified framework, and that a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) -- like structure emerges. Unlike previous approximate treatments, our analytically solvable IPQ-Bath model enables rigorous testing of these strategies, with numerical simulations validating their effectiveness.

### Entanglement Barriers from Computational Complexity: Matrix-Product-State Approach to Satisfiability
* **Authors:** Tim Pokart et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-02-23
* **Updated:** 2026-02-23
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20299v1
* **Abstract:** We approach the 3-SAT satisfiability problem with the quantum-inspired method of imaginary time propagation (ITP) applied to matrix product states (MPS) on a classical computer. This ansatz is fundamentally limited by a quantum entanglement barrier that emerges in imaginary time, reflecting the exponential hardness expected for this NP-complete problem. Strikingly, we argue based on careful analysis of the structure imprinted onto the MPS by the 3-SAT instances that this barrier arises from classical computational complexity. To reveal this connection, we elucidate with stochastic models the specific relationship between the classical hardness of the $\sharp$P $\supseteq$ NP-complete counting problem $\sharp$3-SAT and the entanglement properties of the quantum state. Our findings illuminate the limitations of this quantum-inspired approach and demonstrate how purely classical computational complexity can manifest in quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we present estimates of the non-stabilizerness required by the protocol, finding a similar resource barrier. Specifically, the necessary amount of non-Clifford operations scales superlinearly in system size, thus implying extensive resource requirements of ITP on different architectures such as Clifford circuits or gate-based quantum computers.
