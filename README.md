# Automated arXiv Paper Tracker

This repository is my personal, automated paper tracker. It uses a GitHub Action to run a Python script every 24 hours, scraping [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) for new papers that match my interests.

The keywords I'm currently tracking are defined in `config.ini`.

## Latest Papers Found

*This section is automatically updated by the script every 24 hours.*

<!-- LATEST_PAPERS_START -->

No papers found yet. The script will populate this section on its next run.

<!-- LATEST_PAPERS_END -->

## Full Archive

A complete, persistent JSON database of all papers found by this tracker is available in the `data/archive.json` file.
