* **Abstract:** Quantum computing exploits the properties of Quantum Mechanics to solve problems faster than classical computers. The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements. Finally, we used the Quantum Fourier Transform as an energetic benchmark, comparing the scaling we obtained to that of the execution of the Discrete Fourier Transform in two state-of-the-art classical supercomputers.

### Who can compete with quantum computers? Lecture notes on quantum inspired tensor networks computational techniques
* **Authors:** Xavier Waintal et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-01-06
* **Updated:** 2026-01-06
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03035v1
* **Abstract:** This is a set of lectures on tensor networks with a strong emphasis on the core algorithms involving Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the "quantics" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the "quantics" representation. The lectures have been designed to be accessible to a first-year PhD student and include detailed proofs of all statements.

### Diffusion Computation versus Quantum Computation: A Comparative Model for Order Finding and Factoring
* **Authors:** Carlos A. Cadavid et al.
* **Published (v1):** 2026-01-05
* **Updated:** 2026-01-05
* **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02518v1
* **Abstract:** We study a hybrid computational model for integer factorization in which the only non-classical resource is access to an \emph{iterated diffusion process} on a finite graph. Concretely, a \emph{diffusion step} is defined to be one application of a symmetric stochastic matrix (the half-lazy walk operator) to an $\ell^{1}$--normalized state vector, followed by an optional readout of selected coordinates.   Let $N\ge 3$ be an odd integer which is neither prime nor a prime power, and let $b\in(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\ast$ have odd multiplicative order $r={\rm ord}_N(b)$. We construct, without knowing $r$ in advance, a weighted Cayley graph whose vertex set is the cyclic subgroup $\langle b\rangle$ and whose edges correspond to the powers $b^{\pm 2^t}$ for $t\le \lfloor \log_2 N\rfloor+1$. Using an explicit spectral decomposition together with an elementary doubling lemma, we show that $r$ can be recovered from a single heat-kernel value after at most $O((\log_2 N)^2)$ diffusion steps, with an effective bound.   We then combine this order-finding model with the standard reduction from factoring to order finding (in the spirit of Shor's framework) to obtain a randomized factorization procedure whose success probability depends only on the number $m$ of distinct prime factors of $N$. Our comparison with Shor's algorithm is \emph{conceptual and model-based}. We replace unitary $\ell^2$ evolution by Markovian $\ell^1$ evolution, and we report complexity in two cost measures: digital steps and diffusion steps. Finally, we include illustrative examples and discussion of practical implementations.
